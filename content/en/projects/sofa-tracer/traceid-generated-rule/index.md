### TraceId generation rule

SOFATracer uses TraceId to concatenate the call logs of a request on each server. The TraceId is typically generated by the first server that receives the request. The generation rule is: server IP + generated time + incremental sequence + current process ID, such as:

```text
0ad1348f1403169275002100356696
```

- The first 8 digits `0ad1348f` is the IP of the machine that generates `TraceId`. This is a hexadecimal number, in which every two digits represents a part of IP. Based on the number, we can get a common IP address like `10.209.52.143` by converting every two digits into a decimal number. According to this rule, you can also figure out the first server that the request goes through.
- The next 13 digits `1403169275002` is the time to generate the TraceId.
- The next 4 digits `1003` is an auto-incrementing sequence that increases from 1000 to 9000. After reaching 9000, it returns to 1000 and then restarts to increase.
- The last 5 digits `56696` is the current process ID. Its role in tracerId is to prevent the TraceId conflicts caused by multiple processes in a single machine.

### SpanId generation rule

The SpanId in SOFATracer represents where the current call is in the entire calling link. If a Web system A receives a user request, then in the SOFATracer MVC log of this system, the recorded SpanId is 0, which means the root node of the entire call. If the system A processes this request and needs to call system B, C, and D through RPC, then the SpanIds in the SOFATracer RPC client log of system A are 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3 respectively. And in the SOFATracer RPC server logs of the system B, C, and D, the SpanIds are also 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 respectively. If system C calls system E and F when processing the request, then in the corresponding SOFATracer RPC client log of system C, the SpanIds are 0.2.1 and 0.2.2. And the SpanIds in the SOFATracer RPC server logs of system E and F are also 0.2.1 and 0.2.2. As we can known from above, if all SpanIds in a call can be collected to compose a complete link tree.

We assume that the TraceId generated in a distributed call is `0a1234` (much longer in practice). Then, according to the generation process of SpanId, the call link tree is as shown in the following figure:
