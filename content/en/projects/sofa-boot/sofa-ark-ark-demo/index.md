## Introduction
This sample project shows how to build an executable-ark-jar based on a springboot project with the tool of `sofa-ark-maven-plugin`.

## Preparation
As this project depends on the ark-plugin generated by the project of `sample-ark-plugin`, please ensure the sample sample-ark-plugin installed in your local maven repository before run this project.

## Tools
The `Maven plugin` of `sofa-ark-maven-plugin` is provided to build a standard `executable-ark-jar`, and just needs some simple configurations. Its maven coordinates is: 

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
    <artifactId>sofa-ark-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>${sofa.ark.version}</version>
</plugin>
```

> [Refer to the document of plugin use for details](../sofa-ark-ark-jar)


## Step By Step
Based on the sample project, we will describe step by step how to package a Spring Boot Web project to an executable Ark package

### Creating Spring Boot Web Project
Download a standard Spring Boot Web project from the official website [https://start.spring.io/](https://start.spring.io/) 

### Introducing sample-ark-plugin
Configure items as follows under the main `pom.xml` of the project, and add the `Ark Plugin` dependency generated from another sample project, [reference documents](../sofa-ark-ark-plugin) 

```xml
<dependency>
     <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
     <artifactId>sample-ark-plugin</artifactId>
     <classifier>ark-plugin</classifier>
     <version>${sofa.ark.version}</version>
 </dependency>
```

### Configuring Packaging Plugin
Configure the `Maven` plugin (`sofa-Ark-maven-plugin`) as follows under the main `pom.xml` of the project:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
            <artifactId>sofa-ark-maven-plugin</artifactId>
            <executions>
                <execution>
                    <id>default-cli</id>
                    
                    <!--goal executed to generate executable-ark-jar -->
                    <goals>
                        <goal>repackage</goal>
                    </goals>
                    
                    <configuration>
                        <!--specify destination where executable-ark-jar will be saved, default saved to ${project.build.directory}-->
                        <outputDirectory>./target</outputDirectory>
                        
                        <!--default none-->
                        <arkClassifier>executable-ark</arkClassifier>
                    </configuration>
                </execution>
            </executions>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

In this sample project, we have configured only a fraction of the items, but they are enough to generate an executable `Ark` package. The meaning of each configuration item is shown below:
* outputDirectory: the directory for the output `Ark` package files after packaging of `mvn package`;

* arkClassifier: the value of `classifier` included in the `Maven` coordinates of the `Ark` specified for release, which is null by default;

**Note that arkClassifier is null by default. If you do not specify a classifier, the Jar package uploaded to the repository is actually an executable Ark package. If you need to distinguish it from common packaging, you need to configure a value for this item.**

### Packaging, Installation, and Release
Similar to the operation of common projects, you can complete the installation and release of plugin package with `mvn package`, `mvn install`, and `mvn deploy`;

### Run the application
We offer two ways to start project applications on the Ark container: with the command line or in the IDE. To start in the IDE, additional dependencies need to be added. With the command line, we can directly use `java -jar` to start project applications. Now we will talk about how to start Ark applications in the IDE;

* Spring Boot project: We only need to add the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
    <artifactId>sofa-ark-springboot-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${sofa.ark.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

* Common Java projects:  Compared with Spring Boot projects, we need to add another dependency to common Java projects:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.alipay.sofa</groupId>
    <artifactId>sofa-ark-support-starter</artifactId>
    <version>${sofa.ark.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

In addition, we need to execute container start at the very beginning of the `main` approach of the project, as follows:

```java
public class Application{
    
    public static void main(String[] args) { 
        SofaArkBootstrap.launch(args);
        ...
    }
    
}
```

### Running Test
SOFAArk provides two implementation classes of `org.junit.runner.Runner`: `ArkJUnit4Runner` and `ArkBootRunner`, which are used to integrate JUnit4 test framework and Spring Test respectively. For TestNG test framework, the annotation `@TestNGOnArk` is provided. For any TestNG test cases, only those annotated with `@TestNGOnArk` will run above the Ark Container, otherwise they are the same as common cases.

#### ArkJUnit4Runner
`ArkJUnit4Runner`: Similar to `JUnit4`, we can run common JUnit4 test cases above the SOFAArk container with the annotation `ArkJUnit4Runner`. A sample code is as follows:

```java
@RunWith(ArkJUnit4Runner.class)
public class UnitTest {

    @Test
    public void test() {
        Assert.assertTrue(true);
    }

}
```

The use of `ArkJUnit4Runner` and `JUnit4` is almost the same, and other features of `JUnit4` test framework are fully compatible,

#### ArkBootRunner
`ArkBootRunner` is similar to `SpringRunner`, refer to the [document] (https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/boot-features-testing.html)to learn the usage of `SpringRunner`. To be able to run Spring Boot test cases above the SOFAArk container, we only need to use `@RunWith(ArkBootRunner.class)` to replace `@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)`; A sample code is as follows:

```java
@RunWith(ArkBootRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SpringbootDemoApplication.class)
public class IntegrationTest {

    @Autowired
    private SampleService sampleService;

    @Test
    public void test() {
        Assert.assertTrue("A Sample Service".equals(sampleService.service()));
    }

}
```

The use of `ArkBootRunner` and `SpringRunner` is almost the same;

#### TestNGOnArk
The annotation `@TestNGOnArk` is provided by SOFAArk for developers to mark which TestNG cases run above SOFAArk and which TestNG cases just run normally. For example:

```java
@TestNGOnArk
public class TestNGTest {

    public static final String TEST_CLASSLOADER = "com.alipay.sofa.ark.container.test.TestClassLoader";

    @Test
    public void test() {
        ClassLoader tccl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();
        ClassLoader loader = this.getClass().getClassLoader();
        Assert.assertTrue(tccl.equals(loader));
        Assert.assertTrue(tccl.getClass().getCanonicalName().equals(TEST_CLASSLOADER));
    }

}
```

The above case is annotated with `@TestNGTest`. So when executing it, Ark Container will start first.
