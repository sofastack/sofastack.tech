# Introduction

SOFALookout is a lightweight and open source middleware service of Ant Financial that solves the metrics and monitoring issues of the system. The services it provides include: Event logging, collecting, processing, storing, and querying of Metrics. The open source project consists of two separate parts, the client and server side services.

## Client-side service

SOFALookout Client is a Java SDK that helps developers log events of metrics in project code. It also allows you to view real-time status information for the Java application.
