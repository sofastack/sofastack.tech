Bolt protocol is a TCP-based custom protocol that performs better than HTTP. Within Ant Financial, a large number of RPCs use the Bolt protocol to communicate:
* [Basic usage](../bolt-usage)
* [Calling type](../invoke-type)
* [Timeout control](../bolt-timeout)
* [Generic call](../generic-invoke)
* [Serialization protocol](../serialization)
* [Custom thread pool](../custom-thread-pool)
