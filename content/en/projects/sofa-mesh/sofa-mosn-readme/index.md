MOSN, the short name of Modular Observable Smart Network, is a powerful proxy acting as Service Mesh's data plane like [Envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) but written in Go. MOSN supports Envoy and Istio's APIs and can be integrated with [Istio](https://istio.io/), so we use MOSN instead of Envoy in [SOFAMesh](https://github.com/sofastack/sofa-mesh). The initial version of MOSN was jointly contributed by Ant Financial and UC Business Unit of Alibaba, and we look forward to the community to participate in the follow-up development and build an open source excellent project together.

## Acknowledgement
Thank Google, IBM and Lyft for creating the Envoy and Istio systems and enabling many excellent projects open-sourced, which provides good reference for MOSN so that we can quickly implement our own ideas.
